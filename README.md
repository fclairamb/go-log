# Tiny logging API

This library provides a basic API to be integrated with any logging framework. It
allows to use logging in your libraries without enforcing a particular logging
framework.

It was designed for the [ftpserverlib](https://github.com/fclairamb/ftpserverlib).

It contains a [go-kit/log](https://github.com/go-kit/log) binding but can easily be 
adapted to any logging framework.
